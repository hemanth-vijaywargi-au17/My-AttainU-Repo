"""
What is time complexity of following code :

count = 0
i = N       # The Value of N is unknown
while (i > 0):
    j = 0
    while (j < i ) :
        count += 1
        j = j + 1
    i = i // 2

Options :
A) O(N) * O(logN)
B) O(N ^ 2)
C) O(N)
D) None

"""

# Answer :
# Time Complexity for the Above Program is A) O(N) * O(logN)
